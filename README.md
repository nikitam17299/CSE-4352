# CSE-4352
Project 1 - Built a DHCP Client and a TCP/IP application was added.
Project 2 - IOT support was added by implementing an MQTT Client using a Tivaware Microcontroller and ethernet chip. 
Utilized a TCP State machine that is able to host a telnet server. The system supports publishing topics and subscribing to topics on any MQTT broker. 
Also implemented a shell process that hosts a command line interface through serial bus.
